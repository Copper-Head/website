blurb: >
	I received a 3-year grant from the German Research Foundation [(DFG)](http://www.dfg.de/en/) in support of my research on how Spanish and English native speakers process gender and number agreement in German. I am using this research as a test case to address two important questions: *are some languages more difficult to understand and potentially learn than others? And can this difficulty lie in how a speaker's native language shapes their processing mechanisms?* I will be conducting this work within Shravan Vasishth's lab at the University of Potsdam
