We all make mistakes. This is true of job interviews, haircuts, extra slices of cake and crucially, language. So here is one type of language error that you may have heard before but never thought much about. **How does this sentence sound to you?**

(1) The key to the cabinets are on the table.

Some people say that it sounds fine. Others say that it does not sound quite right, but that it is definitely better than (2):

(2) The key to the cabinet are on the table.

Everyone agrees about (2): it sounds terrible, no one would say that! So this is the question: **why does (1) sound better than (2)? And why is it that errors like (1) appear often, in everyday conversation but also in edited newspapers and texts?**

![examples]({filename}/images/attraction_examples.png){:align="right"}

These errors are called **agreement attraction errors**. And *"cabinets"*, the noun that the verb wrongly agrees with, is called an **attractor**. This name conveys the intuition that *"cabinets"* deceitfully attracts the verb, making it agree with it in number instead of with the "real" subject head, the noun *"key"*. What we don't know though, is why attraction happens in language. What misleads people into making these errors? You might be thinking *"Jeez, it's obvious: "cabinets" is closer to the verb than "key"! Maybe people just produce a verb that agrees with whatever noun is closer to it".* Ok, this is true, but notice that attraction errors occur even when the attractor does not intervene between the verb and its subject: look at the examples above, where the noun *"errors"* triggers attraction despite the fact that *"classification software"* (the real subject) is closer to the verb. So, linear proximity might facilitate attraction, but it cannot be its only cause.

In any case, attraction errors occur often, and now that you know you will probably start noticing them everywhere. And what is interesting about these errors is that from a purely grammatical viewpoint, the fact that they don't sound terrible doesn't make any sense: **sentences like (1) and (2) are equally grammatically bad. In both cases, the verb *"are"* is wrong because it should agree with the head of the subject phrase, *"key"*  **: it is the key that is on the table, not the cabinets. But for some reason, people like these sentences more when the verb agrees in number with *"cabinets"*, which is a modifier (not the head) of the subject phrase.

So, is this a real thing? Well, **we knew since the 90's that people make agreement attraction errors when they talk. But we didn't know whether they also made them in their comprehension. That is, do people notice attraction errors when they hear or read sentences like *"The key to the cabinets are"*?** In 2009, a group of three researchers from the University of Maryland (<http://ling.umd.edu//>), Matt Wagers, Ellen Lau and Colin Phillips set out to find some evidence. They presented people with sentences like (3) below. They varied whether the sentences were grammatical or ungrammatical, and crucially, whether they contained a singular or plural attractor noun. Each sentence had 4 different versions, but of course, each participant in their experiment would see only one:

(3a) The key to the cabinet is on the table.

(3b) The key to the **cabinets** is on the table.

(3c) *The key to the cabinet are on the table.

(3d) *The key to the **cabinets** are on the table.

The important conditions were **(3c-d)**. Both conditions were ungrammatical (that's why by convention they have a * in front). But crucially, (3d) also had a plural attractor noun. Wagers and colleagues were interested in seeing whether this noun would make a difference in people’s judgments. So they tested a group of Maryland students, who read the sentences and were asked to judge whether the sentences were acceptable or unacceptable. The researchers defined "acceptable sentences" as sentences that sounded like normal English sentences, and could be said by any native English speaker. Conversely, "unacceptable sentences" were defined as sentences that an English speakers would be unlikely to say, because they sounded weird or unnatural.

The plot shows what Wagers and his colleagues found. The y-axis indicates the proportion of cases where participants judged the sentences as acceptable. The x-axis shows the 4 different experimental conditions. In the grammatical conditions, participants rated the sentences as acceptable most of the time (above 90% of the time). In these conditions, it didn't seem to matter whether the sentences contained a singular or plural attractor. 

In contrast, the ungrammatical sentences showed an interesting thing. Whereas sentences with a singular attractor like (3c) were deemed unacceptable most of the time, sentences with a plural attractor like (4d) were accepted... more than 1/2 of the time! Participants actually rated them as acceptable around 55% of the time, showing that **these sentences were perceived as more acceptable due to having that plural attractor *"cabinets"* inside them"**. As a result, Wagers and colleagues concluded that indeed, English speakers make errors in comprehension, and can be mislead by plural nouns, thus failing to notice ungrammatical sentences.

So now we know that English speakers are susceptible to attraction errors when they read sentences. Fine, no one is perfect. But why do these errors happen? And how general are they? Could this just be some weird fact about English? 

One problem in answering this question is that we do not know much about how people understand attraction sentences in other languages. Some researchers have looked at Spanish, German and Arabic, but that's pretty much it. And interestingly, **in all languages examined to date there is a striking similarity: plural subjects always require plural verbs**. For instance, take English: we say *"Boys like"* but *"The boy likes"*, and a similar pattern happens in Spanish, German and French.

So for this project, we got interested in a language that differs: Turkish. Here is one cool fact about Turkish: in contrast with many other languages, **when a subject is plural** like *"The detectives" (Dedektifler)*, **Turkish people prefer to use a singular** (e.g. *"works", çalıştı*) **instead of a plural verb** (e.g.  *"work"*, çalıştılar). No one know exactly why, but one possibility is that since Turkish marks plural number by adding the suffixes *-lar/-ler* to both nouns and verbs, people might avoid using plural verbs with plural nouns due to a dispreference towards the repetition of the plural marker: e.g. *The detectives work* (*Dedektifler çalıştılar*, dispreferred) vs. *The detectives works* (*"Dedektifler çalıştı*, preferred).

Given this dispreference towards repeating the plural morpheme, and the contrast between Turkish and English, we wondered: *do Turkish speakers show agreement attraction in configurations like the ones previously tested by Wagers and colleagues in English? Or is agreement attraction absent in Turkish, in contrast with the Indo-European languages tested to date?*

To answer this question, I flew to Ankara and I joined a group of researchers at the Middle East Technical University (<https://fle.metu.edu.tr>): Martina, Bilal, Duygu and Orhan. 

First, we decided to verify that Turkish students preferred plural to singular verbs with plural subjects. We constructed sentences like (4), in four different versions. We had singular subjects with singular verbs (4a) and plural subjects with plural verbs (4b). But also, we designed conditions where the subject and verb mismatched in number: either the subject was singular and the verb was plural (4c) or the other way around (4d).

We were especially interested in cases where the subject was plural and the verb was singular (4d). These cases would be totally bad in English but they should be ok in Turkish, if speakers are really ok using singular verbs to avoid repetition. And in fact, this is what we saw: Turkish speakers judged sentences like (4d) as acceptable almost 99% of the time!

![plurals]({filename}/images/turkish_dispreference.png){:align="right"}


(4a) 	The detective works.
	Dedektif çalıştı.

(4b)	The detectives work.
	Dedektifler çalıştılar.

(4c)	*The detective work.
	Dedektif çalıştılar.

(4d)	*The detectives works.
	Dedektifler çalıştı.
	
What really surprised us though, is what we saw next. To check whether Turkish speakers were sensitive to attraction, we tested sentences similar to those used in English before. We couldn't use sentences exactly like *"They key to the cabinets"* in Turkish. So we used sentences where the attractors were possessor nouns like *"the **students'** advisor"*. We wanted to see whether the possessors would mislead Turkish speakers to accept ungrammatical sentences, just like *"cabinets"* had done to English speakers. And indeed, this is what happened: **Turkish students showed a robust attraction effect** and accepted ungrammatical sentences with plural attractors around 25% of the time, almost 10% more than the fully ungrammatical cases, where the attractor was singular (5c vs. 5d):

![turkish_attraction]({filename}/images/turkish_attraction.png){:align="left"}

(5a) 	The student’s advisor in the classroom suddenly faints.
	Öğrencinin danışmanı sınıfta birden bayıldı.

(5b)	The **students’** advisor in the classroom suddenly faints.
	**Öğrencilerin** danışmanı sınıfta  birden bayıldı.
	
(5c)	* The student’s advisor in the classroom suddenly faint.
	* Öğrencinin  danışmanı sınıfta birden bayıldılar.

(5d)	* The **students’** advisor in the classroom suddenly faint.  
**Öğrencilerin** danışmanı sınıfta birden bayıldılar.


So this is where we are now. Despite disprefering plural subjects with plural verbs, Turkish speakers accept ungrammatical sentences more often when they include, precisely, a plural attractor noun and a plural verb. To us, this means that **attraction errors occur across languages as different as English and Turkish, which have very different morphological preferences**. But then, what causes attraction, and at what level does it happen if it is independent of a language's morphology? This, I think, will be a harder question to answer. Stay tuned for updates!
