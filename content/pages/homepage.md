This is the "about" text. To get you started I pasted from the old site.



I work at the Potsdam Research Institute for Multilingualism (PRIM),
where I conduct psycho- and neurolinguistic studies to examine how
bilingual speakers process syntax during sentence comprehension.


I did my Ph.D. in Linguistics at the University of Maryland, under Colin Phillips and Ellen Lau.
As an undergraduate, I studied at the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina.
