### About
I  do  research  on  human  language.  My  goal  is  to
understand  how  people  integrate  current
and  past  information in real time  when  reading  sentences.  How
do  we  achieve  this  feat  so  quickly  and  effortlessly?
And how is our comprehension shaped by our native
language?
My  work  uses  neurophysiological  (ERP,  MEG),  eye-
tracking and cross-linguistic evidence with the goal of
building  a  cognitive  model  of  the  representations  and
processes that underlie rea-time language
comprehension.
