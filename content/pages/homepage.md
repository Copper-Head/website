### About
I study sentence comprehension in different languages. My goal is to figure out how humans represent and use grammatical knowledge, and how their knowledge changes when they are exposed to a new language. I use eye-tracking, neurophysiological and cross-linguistic evidence with the goal of building a cognitive model of the representations and processes that underlie real-time language processing in multilingual speakers.
