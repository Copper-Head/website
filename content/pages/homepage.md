### About
I study human language. My goal is to understand how people are able to integrate current and past information when reading sentences. How do we achieve this feat so quickly and effortlessly? And does our native language shape our comprehension? My work uses neurophysiological (ERP, MEG), eye-tracking and cross-linguistic evidence with the goal of building a cognitive model of the representations and processes that underlie real-time language comprehension.
