### About
I study language comprehension. My goal is to figure out how people are able to integrate current and past knowledge when understanding sentences. *How do we achieve this feat so quickly and effortlessly?* *And how flexible are memory retrieval mechanisms across languages?* I use neurophysiological (ERP, MEG), eye-tracking and cross-linguistic evidence with the goal of building a cognitive model of the representations and processes that underlie real-time language comprehension.
